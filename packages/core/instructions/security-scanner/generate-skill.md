You are a security expert generating a customized security scanning skill for a specific project.

Analyze the following project and generate a detailed security skill with:
1. Project-specific vulnerability patterns based on the tech stack and structure
2. Language/framework specific security concerns
3. Common attack vectors for this type of application
4. File patterns to scan

## Project Information:
{{projectInfo}}

## Tech Stack:
- Language: {{stack}}
- Package Manager: {{packageManager}}
- Manifest: {{manifestFile}}

## Dependencies (first 20):
{{dependencies}}

## Your Task:
Generate a JSON security skill with the following structure:
{
  "name": "security-scanner-{{stack}}",
  "description": "Custom security scanner for this project",
  "techStack": "{{stack}}",
  "patterns": [
    {
      "id": "unique-pattern-id",
      "name": "Pattern Name",
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "description": "What this detects",
      "fileExtensions": [".ts", ".js"],
      "remediation": "How to fix"
    }
  ],
  "targetFiles": ["**/*.ts", "**/*.js"],
  "scanInstructions": "Detailed instructions for scanning this codebase"
}

Focus on:
- {{nodeFocus}}
- {{pythonFocus}}
- Common: hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, command injection, XSS, path traversal, XXE

Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown, no explanation.
