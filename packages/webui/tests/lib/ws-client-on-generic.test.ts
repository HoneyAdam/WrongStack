/**
 * Type-safety tests for the generic `on<K>()` overload on
 * WrongStackWebSocketClient. These verify at the type-checker level (the
 * test body is mostly compile-time assertions) that:
 *   1. A literal type key narrows the received payload.
 *   2. The wider string overload still accepts a generic handler.
 *
 * Runtime behavior of dispatch is covered elsewhere; this file is a
 * regression guard for the type contract.
