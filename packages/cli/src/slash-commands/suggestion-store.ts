/**
 * Shared suggestion store for /suggest and /next slash commands.
 *
 * Previously, suggestions were stored in a closure variable (`currentSuggestions`)
 * inside cli-main.ts, accessed via the `onSuggestions` callback on
 * `SlashCommandContext`. This closure-based approach works correctly in the REPL
 * but can fail in the TUI when the callback goes through multiple indirections
 * (SlashCommandRegistry → SlashCommand.run → closed-over opts).
 *
 * By using a module-level store, both /suggest (writer) and /next (reader)
 * access the same array directly, bypassing the callback indirection entirely.
 * The CLI's `onSuggestions` callback now reads/writes this shared store to
 * maintain backward compatibility with the REPL autonomy loop's
 * `getSuggestions`/`onSuggestionsParsed` flow.
 *
 * Auto suggestions (items with auto="true" attribute) are stored separately
 * for YOLO+auto autonomy mode.
