# Skill slash commands

The default-active `wstack-skills` plugin registers seven commands when plugins are enabled. Because it is a first-party official plugin, each command has a bare form and a namespaced form such as `/wstack-skills:skill`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/skill [name]` | List discovered skills or show one skill body. |
| `/skill-gen` | Create, inspect, edit, or validate skills. |
| `/skill-search <query> [--page N] [--pageSize N]` | Search configured skill registries; see [skill-search](skill-search.md). |
| `/skill-install <ref> [--global]` | Install from GitHub or a registry ref. |
| `/skill-import <dir> ...` | Copy or link skills from another local agent/tool directory. |
| `/skill-update [name|ref] [--global]` | Refresh installed skills from their source. |
| `/skill-uninstall [name] [--global]` | Remove a skill; with no name, list installed skills in that scope. |

Run `/help <command>` for the full registered help of authoring and import flags. Project installs live under `.wrongstack/skills`; `--global` targets the user-level skill directory.
