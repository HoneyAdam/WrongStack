# Task Crosswalk and Execution Index

## Purpose

This document maps the July 21 audit findings and detailed playbook sections to the canonical task graph. It does not carry task status. Status, hard dependencies, and completion evidence remain in [`../architecture-refactor-task-graph-2026-07.md`](../architecture-refactor-task-graph-2026-07.md).

## Follow-on slices not yet represented by a dedicated canonical node

These slices are required by the audit but must not silently become a second backlog. Before implementation, either attach each slice to the nearest active canonical task with explicit scope or add a reviewed node to the canonical graph.

| Follow-on ID | Scope | Proposed graph relationship | Entry gate | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `F-KANBAN-1` | Break Kanban module cycle | Follow `G1/G3`; may run beside `R2` | SCC report and Kanban behavior fixtures | No Kanban runtime SCC |
| `F-KANBAN-2` | Decompose `_internal` | After `F-KANBAN-1` | Repository/domain boundaries agreed | `_internal` removed or non-authoritative |
| `F-MCP-1` | Separate registry persistence, transport, auth | After `V4`; coordinate with `P3` | MCP contract/lifecycle tests | One-way internal dependencies |
| `F-SDD-1` | Split parallel-run orchestration | After `V4`, protected by `G2` | Scheduler journeys | Explicit scheduler/dispatch/supervisor seams |
| `F-TECH-1` | Remove fake Context cast | Can run after `V2` | Headless research characterization | Narrow dependency and no sentinel cast |
| `F-TELEGRAM-1` | Unify redaction and lifecycle | After `L1` | Redaction parity fixtures | Correct shared utility and disposal |
| `F-LSP-1` | Plugin lifecycle and command split | After `L1/M2` | Plugin smoke and command tests | Manifest/lifecycle adopted |
| `F-BENCH-1` | Public-API-only benchmark consumers | After package moves begin | Benchmark baseline | No internal/source-alias imports |
| `F-APP-1` | Protect thin app wrapper | After `G1` | Architecture rule available | Wrapper remains entrypoint-only |

## Execution packet template

Before a canonical task or follow-on slice begins, create or link an execution packet containing:

```markdown

## Scope
- In scope:
- Out of scope:
- Files/packages expected to change:

## Authority change
- Old authority:
- New authority:
- Compatibility adapter:
- Consumer migrated in this slice:

## Dependencies
- Canonical hard dependencies:

## Suggested delivery batches

### Batch A — Evidence and smallest cycle removal

- `V1`, `G1`, `G2`, `G3` foundations;
- complete Core layer classification;
- SCC reporting;
- direct-import fix for Core errors/utils;
- SimpleUI helper extraction;
- Super Memory text-normalization extraction;
- fallback model parser extraction;
- ACP compatibility wrapper direction.

These cycle fixes are small enough to validate the new architecture gates without beginning broad package movement.

### Batch B — Contract authorities

- `P1` protocol package and fixtures;
- `R3` MemoryPort and adapters;
- `M1` ProviderDefinition pilot;
- `M2` PluginManifest pilot;
- `L1` disposable host handle.

### Batch C — First consumer cutovers

- WebUI Server handshake/read-only handlers;
- one provider across CLI/WebUI/server projections;
- one plugin through data-only lazy manifest;
- Runtime memory composition without unsafe cast;
- CLI memory command consuming MemoryPort.

### Batch D — Behavioral shell decomposition

- TUI journey and input seam;
- CLI boot/dispatch journeys and command context split;
- Director journeys and error/tool contract extraction.

### Batch E — Authority retirement

- embedded CLI WebUI handler deletion after parity;
- manual provider/plugin list deletion;
- no-op security plugin replacement/removal;
- inline HQ application retirement;
- Core feature implementation moves.

### Batch F — Foundation close and follow-on packages

- Runtime pilot decision and migrations;
- persistence and Super Memory decomposition;
- Kanban internals;
- MCP/SDD/Desktop consolidation;
- documentation and architecture-reference refresh;
- compatibility export retirement.
